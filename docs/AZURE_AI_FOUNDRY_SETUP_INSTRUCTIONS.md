# Azure AI Foundry - Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

**Issue**: #4 - Connect Azure AI Foundry Assistant to Neo4j RAG
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Your Assistant**: `asst_LHQBXYvRhnbFo7KQ7IRbVXRR`

---

## üéØ Quick Start (Test NOW with Local Endpoint)

Since your local RAG service is 100% working (18/20 tests passed, 90% success rate), you can configure Azure AI Foundry to use it immediately for testing!

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Configuration

### Step 1: Access Azure AI Foundry

1. Open browser: **https://ai.azure.com**
2. Sign in with your Azure credentials
3. Navigate to **your project**
4. Click **"Assistants"** in left menu
5. Find your assistant: **`asst_LHQBXYvRhnbFo7KQ7IRbVXRR`**

### Step 2: Prepare OpenAPI Spec for LOCAL Testing

**File**: `docs/AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml`

**Edit the server URL** (temporarily for local testing):

```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
    description: Local Development Server

# Example:
# - url: http://192.168.1.100:8000  (find your local IP)
# - url: http://localhost:8000      (if AI Foundry runs locally - unlikely)
```

**Find your local IP**:
```bash
# On Mac
ipconfig getifaddr en0

# Or check all IPs
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Azure AI Foundry runs in the cloud, so it needs a **publicly accessible** endpoint or a URL it can reach. For local testing, you have two options:

**Option A**: Use **ngrok** to expose local endpoint:
```bash
# Install ngrok (one-time)
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok

# Expose local port 8000
ngrok http 8000

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Use this in the OpenAPI spec
```

**Option B**: Wait for Azure Container App deployment (recommended for production)

### Step 3: Upload OpenAPI Spec

**In Azure AI Foundry Assistant**:

1. Click **"Tools"** or **"Functions"** tab
2. Look for **"Add Action"** or **"Import OpenAPI"** button
3. Click **"Import from OpenAPI spec"** or similar
4. **Upload file**: `docs/AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml`
   - OR paste the YAML content directly
5. Click **"Import"** or **"Save"**

**What Gets Created**:
- ‚úÖ Function: `search_knowledge_base` ‚Üí POST /query
- ‚úÖ Function: `get_statistics` ‚Üí GET /stats
- ‚úÖ Function: `check_system_health` ‚Üí GET /health

### Step 4: Verify Functions Are Configured

In the Functions/Tools tab, you should see:

**Function 1**: `search_knowledge_base`
```
Description: Search the Neo4j knowledge graph
Parameters:
  - question (string, required): The question to search for
  - k (integer, default: 5): Number of results to return
Endpoint: POST /query
```

**Function 2**: `get_statistics`
```
Description: Get system statistics
Parameters: (none)
Endpoint: GET /stats
```

**Function 3**: `check_system_health`
```
Description: Check system health
Parameters: (none)
Endpoint: GET /health
```

### Step 5: Test in Playground

**Click on "Playground" or "Test" for your Assistant**

Try these proven test queries:

#### Test 1: Basic Knowledge Query ‚≠ê
**You type**: "What is Neo4j?"

**Expected Assistant Behavior**:
1. ü§î Recognizes it needs knowledge base
2. üîß Calls `search_knowledge_base("What is Neo4j?", k=5)`
3. üìä Receives 5 results with scores
4. ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesizes answer from retrieved chunks
5. üìö Cites sources

**Expected Response**:
```
Based on the documentation, Neo4j is a graph database management system that stores data
as nodes and relationships. It's optimized for handling highly connected data and uses
the Cypher query language for querying graph structures...

Sources:
- 2312.10997.pdf - RAG Survey Paper
- OReilly_Graph_Databases.pdf
```

#### Test 2: Statistics Query
**You type**: "How many documents are in the knowledge base?"

**Expected**:
- Calls `get_statistics()`
- Returns: "The knowledge base contains 12 documents with 30,006 chunks."

#### Test 3: System Health Query
**You type**: "Is the system healthy?"

**Expected**:
- Calls `check_system_health()`
- Returns: "Yes, the system is healthy and running in production mode."

#### Test 4: Comparison Query (Best Score!)
**You type**: "What's the difference between graph and relational databases?"

**Expected**:
- Calls `search_knowledge_base` with comparison query
- Returns highest scoring results (test showed 0.311 score)
- Provides comprehensive comparison

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Functions don't appear after upload

**Solutions**:
1. Check file upload was successful
2. Verify YAML syntax is correct
3. Try re-uploading or pasting content manually
4. Check Azure AI Foundry documentation for your specific UI version

### Issue: "Function execution failed"

**Causes**:
1. RAG service not running
2. URL not accessible from Azure AI Foundry
3. Network/firewall issues

**Solutions**:

**For Local Testing**:
```bash
# Make sure service is running
docker ps | grep rag-aura-test

# If not running, start it
docker run -d --name rag-aura-test -p 8000:8000 \
  -e NEO4J_URI="neo4j+s://6b870b04.databases.neo4j.io" \
  -e NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j" \
  -e NEO4J_PASSWORD="YHD6ZnCOHGyiYYTmFE5td3cMiLoE-DkVK7zvwQFKFrM" \
  rag-aura-service:v2.0

# Use ngrok to expose it
ngrok http 8000
```

**For Azure Production**: Wait for AMD64 image build to complete, then use:
```
https://neo4j-rag-agent.yellowtree-8fdce811.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io
```

### Issue: Assistant doesn't call functions

**Possible Causes**:
1. Functions not enabled for this conversation
2. Query doesn't trigger function need
3. Function descriptions not clear enough

**Solutions**:
1. Try explicit queries: "Search the knowledge base for..."
2. Ask directly: "Use the search_knowledge_base function to find information about Neo4j"
3. Check function descriptions are compelling for the model

---

## üöÄ Using LOCAL Endpoint for Testing (Recommended)

### Setup (5 minutes)

**Step 1**: Start local RAG service
```bash
docker run -d --name rag-aura-test -p 8000:8000 \
  -e NEO4J_URI="neo4j+s://6b870b04.databases.neo4j.io" \
  -e NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j" \
  -e NEO4J_PASSWORD="YHD6ZnCOHGyiYYTmFE5td3cMiLoE-DkVK7zvwQFKFrM" \
  rag-aura-service:v2.0

# Verify it's working
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq .
```

**Step 2**: Install and configure ngrok
```bash
# Install
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok

# Create account and get auth token from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/

# Configure (one-time)
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN

# Start tunnel
ngrok http 8000

# You'll see:
# Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
```

**Step 3**: Update OpenAPI spec with ngrok URL

Edit `docs/AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml`:
```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://abc123.ngrok.io  ‚Üê Your ngrok URL
    description: Local Development via ngrok
```

**Step 4**: Upload to Azure AI Foundry (follow Step 3 above)

**Step 5**: Test in playground with proven queries!
