**Status**: Ready for Configuration

---

## üéØ Overview

This guide shows you how to configure your Azure AI Foundry Assistant (`asst_LHQBXYvRhnbFo7KQ7IRbVXRR`) to use the Neo4j RAG system with 30,006 chunks from 12 documents.

**What You'll Achieve**:
- ‚úÖ Assistant can search the Neo4j knowledge base
- ‚úÖ Returns relevant answers from 30,006 indexed chunks
- ‚úÖ Provides source attribution with metadata
- ‚úÖ Fast responses with 310x cache speedup

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working

**Neo4j Aura Database**:
- Instance: `6b870b04.databases.neo4j.io`
- Documents: 12
- Chunks: 30,006
- Status: ‚úÖ Active and tested

**RAG Service** (Choose One):

**Option A**: Local Service (For Testing/Demo)
```bash
# Start local service
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e NEO4J_URI="neo4j+s://6b870b04.databases.neo4j.io" \
  -e NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j" \
  -e NEO4J_PASSWORD="YHD6ZnCOHGyiYYTmFE5td3cMiLoE-DkVK7zvwQFKFrM" \
  rag-aura-service:v2.0

# Verify working
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq .
```

**Option B**: Azure Container App (For Production)
- URL: `https://neo4j-rag-agent.yellowtree-8fdce811.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io`
- Status: ‚è≥ Awaiting AMD64 image deployment
- Once deployed, verify with:
  ```bash
  curl https://neo4j-rag-agent.yellowtree-8fdce811.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io/health
  ```

## üöÄ Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Access Azure AI Foundry

1. Open: https://ai.azure.com
2. Sign in with your Azure credentials
3. Navigate to your project
4. Go to **"Assistants"** section
5. Find your assistant: `asst_LHQBXYvRhnbFo7KQ7IRbVXRR`

### Step 2: Upload OpenAPI Specification

**File Location**: `docs/AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml`

**Upload Process**:

1. In your Assistant, click **"Functions"** tab
2. Click **"+ Add Function"** or **"Import"**
3. Select **"Import from OpenAPI"**
4. Upload file: `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml`

**What This Does**:
- Automatically configures 3 functions
- Sets correct endpoint URLs
- Defines request/response schemas
- Adds function descriptions for GPT model

### Step 3: Update Server URL

If using local service, update the server URL in the uploaded spec:

**For Local Testing**:
```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:8000
    description: Local Development Server
```

**For Azure Production**:
```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://neo4j-rag-agent.yellowtree-8fdce811.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io
    description: Azure Container Apps Production
```

### Step 4: Verify Function Configuration

Your Assistant should now have 3 functions:

#### Function 1: `search_knowledge_base`
```json
{
  "name": "search_knowledge_base",
  "description": "Search the Neo4j knowledge graph for relevant information",
  "parameters": {
    "question": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The question to search for",
      "required": true
    },
    "k": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Number of results to return",
      "default": 5
    }
  },
  "endpoint": "POST /query"
}
```

#### Function 2: `get_statistics`
```json
{
  "name": "get_statistics",
  "description": "Get database statistics including document and chunk counts",
  "parameters": {},
  "endpoint": "GET /stats"
}
```

#### Function 3: `check_system_health`
```json
{
  "name": "check_system_health",
  "description": "Check system health and connection status",
  "parameters": {},
  "endpoint": "GET /health"
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Assistant

### Test Sequence (Proven Working Queries)

Run these tests in your Azure AI Foundry Playground:

#### Test 1: Basic Knowledge Query ‚≠ê
**Your Question**: "What is Neo4j?"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Assistant calls `search_knowledge_base` function
2. Function queries Neo4j Aura with embedding
3. Returns top 5 relevant chunks
4. Assistant synthesizes answer from chunks
5. Cites sources

**Expected Response** (Example):
```
Neo4j is a graph database management system that stores data as nodes
and relationships. According to the documentation, it provides powerful
querying capabilities through Cypher language and excels at handling
connected data...

Sources:
- 2312.10997.pdf (RAG Survey Paper)
- OReilly_Graph_Databases.pdf
```

**Validation**:
- ‚úÖ Function was called
- ‚úÖ Returned results from Aura
- ‚úÖ Response includes source attribution
- ‚úÖ Answer is coherent and relevant

#### Test 2: RAG-Specific Query
**Your Question**: "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation and how does it work?"

**Expected**:
- Calls `search_knowledge_base`
- Returns RAG-specific content (proven in Test 5)
- Explains RAG architecture

**Validation**:
- ‚úÖ Contains RAG technical details
- ‚úÖ Explains retrieval and generation phases

#### Test 3: Comparison Query (Best Performance)
**Your Question**: "What's the difference between graph and relational databases?"

**Expected**:
- Highest relevance score: 0.311 (proven in Test 15)
- Best performing query in test suite
- Comprehensive comparison

#### Test 4: Statistics Query
**Your Question**: "How many documents are in the knowledge base?"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Assistant calls `get_statistics` function
2. Returns: `{"documents": 12, "chunks": 30006, ...}`
3. Assistant responds: "The knowledge base contains 12 documents with 30,006 chunks."

#### Test 5: Health Check Query
**Your Question**: "Is the system healthy and connected to the database?"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Assistant calls `check_system_health`
2. Returns: `{"status": "healthy", "mode": "production", ...}`
3. Assistant responds: "Yes, the system is healthy and running in production mode..."

# Start service
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e NEO4J_URI="neo4j+s://6b870b04.databases.neo4j.io" \
  -e NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j" \
  -e NEO4J_PASSWORD="<password>" \
  rag-aura-service:v2.0

# Pre-warm cache with demo queries
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Neo4j?", "k": 5}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is RAG?", "k": 5}'

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq .
```

**Option B: Azure Demo**:
```bash
# Verify deployment
curl https://neo4j-rag-agent.yellowtree-8fdce811.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io/health | jq .

# Pre-warm cache

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Assistant doesn't call functions

**Check**:
1. OpenAPI spec uploaded correctly
2. Function names match spec: `search_knowledge_base`, `get_statistics`, `check_system_health`
3. Server URL is correct and accessible

**Solution**:
- Re-upload OpenAPI spec
- Test endpoints manually: `curl <endpoint>/health`
- Check Azure AI Foundry logs

### Issue: "Function execution failed"

**Possible Causes**:
1. RAG service not running
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Invalid Aura credentials

**Debug**:
```bash
# Test endpoint directly
curl -X POST <your-url>/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "test", "k": 3}'

# Check health
curl <your-url>/health

# View Container App logs (if using Azure)
az containerapp logs show \
  --name neo4j-rag-agent \
  --resource-group rg-neo4j-rag-bitnet
```

### Issue: Slow responses

**Solutions**:
1. **Pre-warm cache**: Run common queries before demo
2. **Check model loading**: First query is slower (loads embeddings)
3. **Monitor Aura**: Check database connection health

**Performance Targets**:
- First query: <5s (acceptable with model loading)
- Cached queries: <100ms (validated at 13.5ms)
- Health/stats: <500ms (validated at ~300ms)

## üìä Expected Performance in Azure AI Foundry

Based on our test results:

### Response Times

| Query Type | Time Range | User Experience |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| First query | 3-5s | "Acceptable - thinking..." |
| Cached query | <100ms | "Instant - feels native" |
| Statistics | ~300ms | "Fast - real-time" |
| Health check | ~300ms | "Fast - real-time" |

### Function Call Flow

```
User: "What is Neo4j?"
  ‚Üì

## üéâ Expected Demo Flow

### Your Azure AI Foundry Playground Test

**You**: "What is Neo4j?"

**Assistant** (thinking):
```
[Function call: search_knowledge_base]
- question: "What is Neo4j?"
- k: 5

[Returns 5 results with scores 0.24, 0.23, 0.19, ...]

[Generating response from retrieved context...]
```

**Assistant** (response):
```
Neo4j is a graph database management system that stores data as
nodes and relationships, optimized for handling highly connected
data. According to the RAG survey paper, it's particularly effective
for use cases involving complex relationships and network analysis.

The system uses Cypher query language for querying graph data and
provides excellent performance for traversing relationships compared
to traditional relational databases.
