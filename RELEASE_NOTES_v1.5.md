## 🆕 What's New

### Comprehensive Playwright Test Suite (Issue #12)

**150+ automated tests** covering all UI components, integration workflows, and cloud deployment scenarios:

- **Smoke Tests** (13 tests) - Quick validation, all passing
- **UI Component Tests** (40+ tests) - Header, health cards, chat, sidebar, upload, stats
- **Integration Tests** (20 tests) - Service integration and error handling
- **Cloud Tests** (40+ tests) - Azure deployment testing
- **Interactive Tools** - UI explorer, visual regression, mockup comparison

**Test Infrastructure**:
- Playwright MCP server integration
- Automated test runners (`run_ui_tests.sh`, `test-cloud.sh`)
- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- HTML report generation with 6 view captures
- Comprehensive documentation (11 testing guides)

**Results**: All smoke tests passing (13/13), infrastructure ready for CI/CD

### Azure Container Apps Architecture

**Major architectural update** - removed Azure Cosmos DB confusion:

- ✅ **Neo4j Database** deployed as Azure Container App (not Cosmos DB)
- ✅ **RAG Service** deployed as Azure Container App with auto-scaling (1-10 instances)
- ✅ **Azure AI Foundry** for managed AI agents (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- ✅ **Hybrid Approach**: Knowledge base in cloud, AI models as SaaS
- ❌ **No BitNet in Azure** (local development only)
- ❌ **No Streamlit in Azure** (local development only)

**Cost**: ~$326/month for Neo4j + RAG Container Apps

**Deployment**:
- Automated deployment script: `scripts/azure-deploy-enterprise.sh`
- Complete documentation: 5 comprehensive guides
- Local testing against cloud services
- Enterprise features: Managed Identity, Key Vault, Application Insights

### UI Fixes and Improvements

**Fixed all identified issues** from mockup comparison:

**Stats API**:
- ✅ Returns flat structure with `document_count`, `chunk_count`
- ✅ Includes `avg_response_time_ms`, `cache_hit_rate`, `memory_mb`
- ✅ Live data now displays correctly (no more "N/A")

**Streamlit App**:
- ✅ Data mapping fixed to read correct API response paths
- ✅ Service health detection uses localhost URLs
- ✅ API URL auto-detection (tries localhost, then Docker hostnames)
- ✅ Theme config created with mockup colors (#0E1117, #262730, #FF4B4B)

**Sample Data**:
- ✅ 40 documents loaded into Neo4j
- ✅ 53,352 chunks indexed and searchable
- ✅ Real data for testing and demonstration

### Documentation Overhaul

**README.md Improvements**:
- ✅ Catchy headline: "🚀 Intelligent Knowledge Base: Neo4j + RAG + AI Agents"
- ✅ 2-3 sentence explanations after every headline and subheadline
- ✅ Clear hybrid approach (local + Azure) with concise descriptions
- ✅ Removed source code blocks (linked to detailed docs)
- ✅ Reduced from 500+ to ~400 lines while preserving all important content

**New Documentation** (11 guides):
- UI Testing Guide (comprehensive)
- Quick Start guides (UI and Cloud)
- Issue analysis and fix guides
- Test results location guide
- Azure deployment guides
- Cloud testing procedures

**Image Organization**:
- ✅ All images moved to `docs/images/`
- ✅ SEO-optimized filenames (neo4j-rag-streamlit-chat-interface.png, etc.)
- ✅ Descriptive alt text for accessibility
- ✅ Removed duplicate and unused images

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes

1. **Stats API Structure** (`app_local.py:108-158`)
   - Fixed to return flat structure with document_count, chunk_count
   - Resolved "N/A" display issue in Streamlit
   - Live data now shows correctly

2. **Service Health Detection** (`streamlit_app/app.py:152-204`)
   - Fixed Docker hostname issues
   - Added localhost URL detection
   - Health cards now show correct status with response times

3. **API URL Auto-Detection** (`streamlit_app/app.py:24-48`)
   - Tries multiple hostnames (localhost, rag-service-optimized, bitnet-optimized-rag)
   - Works in both Docker and local environments
   - Eliminates connection errors

4. **Azure Architecture Diagram**
   - Removed incorrect "Azure Cosmos DB with Neo4j API"
