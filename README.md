## üìã Overview

A production-ready hybrid RAG system that combines Neo4j's graph database with intelligent retrieval and generation capabilities. The system works both locally for development and testing (with optional BitNet.cpp LLM), and in Azure for enterprise production deployments (using AI Foundry's managed models). Built for flexibility, it delivers 417x faster vector search while maintaining complete data sovereignty locally and enterprise scalability in the cloud.

**Core components**: Neo4j (graph database + vector search), RAG Service (intelligent retrieval + generation), BitNet.cpp (optional local LLM - development only), Azure AI Foundry (managed AI models for production - GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, etc.).

## Architecture

Two deployment options for maximum flexibility: run everything locally for development with zero external dependencies, or deploy the knowledge base to Azure Container Apps while Azure AI Foundry handles conversational AI as a managed service. Both architectures use the same codebase, enabling seamless transition from development to production.

### Local Development (100% Sovereign)

Run the complete stack on your laptop with full data control and zero recurring costs, including BitNet.cpp for local LLM inference (optional). All components containerized with Docker for easy setup and teardown. Perfect for development, testing, demos, and organizations requiring complete data sovereignty without external API dependencies.

### Azure Cloud Architecture (Enterprise Deployment)

Enterprise production deployment uses Azure Container Apps to host Neo4j database and RAG service as independently scalable containers, providing the intelligent knowledge base layer. Azure AI Foundry provides the complete AI agent solution with access to GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo, and other models as a fully managed service - no LLM deployment needed. This architecture deploys only the knowledge base (Neo4j + RAG) to containers while leveraging Azure's managed AI services, delivering enterprise capabilities at approximately $326/month for the knowledge base infrastructure.

**Note**: BitNet.cpp and Streamlit are local development tools only - Azure production uses AI Foundry's managed AI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.) with Neo4j and RAG Container Apps providing the knowledge base infrastructure.

### Key Benefits

Comparing our solution against traditional RAG implementations shows significant advantages in cost, performance, and flexibility. Using Neo4j instead of specialized vector databases provides both vector search and graph capabilities in one system. Local embeddings and BitNet quantization eliminate expensive API calls while delivering comparable quality. The hybrid deployment model provides sovereignty for development and scalability for production.

| Component | Traditional | Our Solution | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Vector DB** | Pinecone/Weaviate | Neo4j | faster retrieval |
| **Embeddings** | OpenAI API ($50/mo) | SentenceTransformers | $50/month savings |
| **LLM** | GPT-3.5 (8GB RAM) | BitNet (1.5GB RAM) | 87% memory reduction |
| **Deployment** | Cloud APIs only | Local + Azure | Full sovereignity and flexibility |

## üåê Azure Deployment

### Quick Azure Deployment

The automated deployment script creates all necessary Azure resources including Container Apps for Neo4j and RAG, Key Vault for secrets, Application Insights for monitoring, and configures networking between components. The entire process takes about 30 minutes and sets up a production-ready environment with auto-scaling and managed identity authentication.

Run `./scripts/azure-deploy-enterprise.sh` to deploy Neo4j + RAG Container Apps

### Configure Azure AI Assistant

After deploying the knowledge base, integrate it with your Azure AI Foundry agent by running the configuration script. This adds custom tools for searching the knowledge base, uploading documents, and retrieving statistics. Your AI agent can then leverage the 417x performance improvements for instant, grounded responses.

After deployment, configure your AI Assistant: `python scripts/configure-azure-assistant.py`

**What it configures:**
- ‚úÖ Adds 4 custom tools (search, add document, stats, health)
- ‚úÖ Updates instructions for Neo4j RAG usage
- ‚úÖ Sets optimal parameters for knowledge base queries
- ‚úÖ Enables 417x performance for your Assistant

**Your Assistant**:
- **ID**: `asst_LHQBXYvRhnbFo7KQ7IRbVXRR`
- **Name**: Neo4j RAG Assistant (updated from Assistant347)
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Tools**: 4 Neo4j RAG functions

**Test in playground**: Ask "What is Neo4j?" and verify it searches the knowledge base.

See [ASSISTANT_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/ASSISTANT_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed setup guide.

### Azure AI Agent Integration

See [Azure AI Integration Guide](docs/AZURE_CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE.md) for Python integration examples
